5) To make the vinaigrette, mix the red wine vinegar, olive oil, peppadews, sugar, oregano and garlic. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.<p>
6) Spoon 2 tbsp of the vinaigrette into the bottom of a large bowl. Layer the aubergine slices with the chopped mint, parsley, and the vinaigrette. Top with more of the vinaigrette and marinate, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. (You can also add more minced garlic and grated Parmesan to the layers.)<p>
7) Boil the lasagne noodles with a little oil, so that they do not stick, and some salt, to impart some flavour.<p>
8) In a beautiful serving dish layer the marinated aubergine and the noodles, then sprinkle with some fresh mozzarella, then the basil and finally drizzle with the vinaigrette. <p>

                            Saffron aioli: 
<br/><br/>1) Lightly sprinkle the garlic with a pinch of the salt and smash it into a paste with the side of a cook's knife. Set aside.
<br/><br/>2) Pour about 5cm of water into a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
<br/><br/>3) In a medium, heatproof bowl, whisk together the remaining salt, egg yolk, vinegar, water, lemon juice and saffron until light and frothy. Place the bowl over the simmering water and whisk constantly until the yolk mixture is just warmer than room temperature, about 20 seconds. Remove from the heat and whisk in the garlic paste.<br/><br/>4) While whisking constantly, gradually drizzle in the olive oil until a smooth and slightly thick sauce is formed. Store in the refrigerator until ready to use.
<br/><br/>Sweet potatoes: 
<br/><br/>1) Meanwhile, position a rack in the centre of the oven and preheat to 220C/Gas 7.
<br/><br/>2) Put a baking sheet on the centre rack and preheat for 10 minutes.
<br/><br/>3) Quarter the sweet potatoes and leave the skins on. In a large bowl, toss the wedges with the olive oil. Carefully remove the hot baking sheet from the oven and evenly place the wedges on the pan, cut-side down. Bake until the bottoms of the potatoes are lightly browned, about 15 minutes. <br/><br/>4) Carefully remove the hot baking sheet from the oven. Turn the wedges so the other cut side comes in contact with the hot baking sheet. Continue to bake the sweet potatoes until both sides are browned and tender, about 15 minutes more.
<br/><br/>To serve, arrange the sweet potatoes on a platter and season with salt, to taste. Drizzle the potatoes with some of the aioli. Serve warm.<br/><br/>Cook's note: We recommend golden olive oil for its smooth finish and low acidity. The golden colour comes from olive pressed at the peak of ripeness. These oils are made in the American state of California, southern France and Sicily.<br/><br/>*RAW EGG WARNING <br/><br/>Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell.<br/>

                            1) Take 3/4 of the strawberries and prepare a coulis: slice thinly then add into a saucepan with 1 tbsp of sugar and the juice from the lemon and the sprig of mint. Add a tbsp of Pimm's. <p>
2) Slowly poach the strawberries so that they let out their juice; you don't want to mash them. Stir carefully to coat all the fruit in the juice and Pimm's mixture. Simmer gently to allow the fruit/ liquid mixture to reduce slightly, then take off the heat and drain the juices into a jug. To this jug, add another tbsp of Pimm's and stir.<p>
3) In the mean time, beat the double cream until it forms soft peaks, then add 2 tbsp of Pimm's and beat in the mascarpone. When the mix is combined, warm the strawberry jam in the microwave for 30 secs, then fold in 3 tbsp of jam so you get a ripple effect <p>
4) Start to put the trifle together by layering a glass dish or individual glasses with sponge fingers. If you're using madeira cake, cut 1cm thick slices. When the bottom of the dish is lined, drizzle the Pimm's/strawberry juice mixture to soak the sponge. Spoon over a layer of strawberries (to add interesting texture, you could slice some extra strawberries and add in at this point). <p>
5) Spread a layer of the mascarpone/ cream mixture. Repeat with another sponge layer and so on until you reach the top of the bowl. The last layer should be a layer of cream/mascarpone.<p> 
6) To finish, take the rest of the strawberries and slice thinly. Carefully layer these over the top of the trifle to cover the entire top. Warm through a tablespoon of jam, then brush this on the top. Put the container in the fridge to chill for at least 1 hour.

<br/>
<br/>In large bowl, stir together the apples, brown sugar, granulated sugar, flour, salt and lemon juice. Set aside and see how long you can keep from sneaking a slice of apple.

<br/>
<br/>With a rolling pin, begin rolling out the Perfect Pie Crusts into large circles. Roll the dough from the center outward. Be gentle and patient, it'll take a little time to get the dough completely rolled out.

<br/>
<br/>If you think the bottom is really sticking to the surface below, use a nice, sharp spatula to loosen the dough and sprinkle some extra flour on top. Then flip it over to finish rolling. Remember to roll from the center in single, outward strokes, no back-and-forth rolling.

<br/>
<br/>Again with a spatula, loosen and lift the dough and carefully place the circles on large baking sheets.

<br/>
<br/>Place half the apple mixture on one crust and the other half on the other crust. Fold over the edges of each crust so that it covers 2 to 3 inches of the apple mixture. No need to be artistic - the more rustic the better. Dot the tops of the pies with chunks of the butter.

<br/>
<br/>Bake until the filling is golden and bubbly, 30 to 40 minutes. If the crust appears to brown too quickly, cover the edges with aluminium foil for the remaining baking time.

<br/>
<br/>Allow to cool slightly, then slice into wedges with a pizza cutter. Eat 'em on the go!Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Add in the butter and shortening. Using a pastry cutter, gradually work the butter and shortening into the flour until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles. This step should take 3 or 4 minutes.

<br/>Lightly beat the egg with a fork, and then add it to the mixture. Next, add in the cold water and vinegar. Stir the mixture together until it's just combined, and then remove half the dough from the bowl. Yield: dough for 2 crusts.

<p>1. To make the dough: In a small bowl, combine the yeast, sugar and water and stir gently to dissolve. Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>2. If you're using a stand mixer, combine the salt and flour to the bowl and pulse a few times to mix. Add the yeast mixture, at the lowest speed, until the flour incorporates. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough gathers into a ball. This should take about 2 minutes. Add the olive oil and pulse a few more times. Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Get a feel for the dough as you're making it by squeezing a small amount together between your thumb and fingers.  If it's crumbly, add more water, if it's sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it over itself a few times, kneading until it's smooth and elastic.</p>
<p>3. If you're making the dough by hand, add the yeast mixture to a large bowl and stir in the salt and the 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Then begin stirring in the flour. When the mixture becomes too stiff to stir with a spoon, knead in the rest of the flour by hand, adding just enough so that the dough is soft but not too sticky.  As you work, squeeze a small amount of dough together between your thumb and fingers. If it's crumbly, add more water; if it's sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>4. Form the dough into a round and put it into a lightly oiled bowl, turning it over to coat the dough entirely with the oil.  Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot (i.e., over a gas pilot light) until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.</p>
<p>5. Preheat the oven to 220°C. Put a Swiss roll tin or a sheet tray in the oven.</p><p>Begin by making the tomato sauce. In a large saute pan over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons olive oil, the minced garlic, thyme and oregano. Cook until just fragrant then add the crushed tomatoes and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Lower the heat and simmer for 7 to 8 minutes to reduce and concentrate the flavor. Shut off the heat and set aside.</p>
<p>6. Take the preheated pan out of the oven and drizzle some olive oil over the entire surface. Cut the dough into 2 pieces and reserve 1 piece for another use. Stretch the pizza dough out so it is just bigger than the pan, then lay it inside the pan, so the dough comes up the sides to form a crust on the rim. Smear with tomato sauce then tear up the mozzarella and scatter it evenly over the top of the pie. Tear the basil leaves, spread them over the top and drizzle with a little more olive oil.  Give it a final season with salt and pepper, to taste, then bake in the hot oven until golden and bubbly, about 15 to 18 minutes</p>

4) Roast the chicken for one hour. Remove the bacon from the top of the chicken and set aside. Continue roasting the chicken for an additional 30 minutes, or until the juices run clear when you cut between a leg and a thigh. Transfer to a platter and cover with aluminium foil while you prepare the gravy.<p>
5) Remove all but two tbsp of the fat from the bottom of the pan. Add the wine and chicken stock and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for five minutes, or until reduced by half. <p>

<p>Preheat the oven to Gas Mark 5, 190°C, 170°C fan, 375°F.</p>
<p>I like to season my chicken with a Knorr Chicken Stock Cube. Crumble the Knorr Chicken Stock Cube into the olive oil, mixing into a paste until the cube has dissolved.  Rub the paste over the chicken to season it.</p>
<p>Pour a little olive oil into a roasting tin and place the seasoned chicken in the tin. Roast for 1 hour to 1 hour ten minutes until the chicken is cooked through. Make sure you check that the chicken is thoroughly cooked by inserting a skewer into the chicken near the leg; if the juices run clear, then the chicken is cooked through. If the juices are bloody, then cook the chicken for a little longer. As I often say, use your eyes when you cook.</p>
<p>Remove the chicken from the oven and set aside to rest in the roasting tray until still warm but just cool enough to handle.</p>
<p>Remove the chicken from the roasting tray and place the roasting tray on the hob. Now make the hot vinaigrette dressing. Heat the roasting juices in the pan until hot, then add in the white wine vinegar, shaking the pan to dissolve the roasting juices into the vinegar. You want to cook this until the vinegar has reduced by two-thirds and is almost syrupy.</p>
<p>While the vinegar is reducing, cut the warm chicken into serving pieces, using a sharp knife. Watch me and you’ll see how easy this is. First cut off the legs, then cut through the joints to separate the legs into thighs and drumsticks. Cut off the wings. Cut the breasts off the chicken, then slice the breasts into portions. Place the legs, wings and breast pieces on a serving platter. Sprinkle the finely chopped shallot over the chicken. I’m very fond of shallots, as you might have noticed.</p>
<p>Now finish off the dressing. Add the olive oil to the reduced vinegar and stir in. Taste to check the seasoning and adjust to taste. Spoon the hot vinaigrette over the portioned chicken. Garnish with basil, parsley and chives and serve at once.</p>
<p>This would be nice with a fresh tomato salad, a potato salad or simply boiled new potatoes.</p>

3) Tie the legs together with kitchen string and tuck the wing tips under the body of the chicken. Place the onions, carrots, and fennel in a roasting pan. Toss with salt, pepper, 20 sprigs of thyme, and olive oil. Spread around the bottom of the roasting pan and place the chicken on top. <p>
4) Roast the chicken for 1 1/2 hours, or until the juices run clear when you cut between a leg and thigh. Remove the chicken and vegetables to a platter and cover with aluminium foil for about 20 minutes. Slice the chicken onto a platter and serve it with the vegetables. <p>

<b>Notes</b>: <i>In Hong Kong they love and are famed for their skill at rotisserie-style cooking, where whole ducks, chickens and pigs, with their entrails, are roasted to a golden or soy colour. Many eateries display a range of cooked food in their window fronts to entice diners.<br/>
Inspired by this style of cooking, my simple five-spice roasted drumsticks make a simple dinner.</i><br/>

1) In a bowl, combine the garlic, ginger, honey, soy sauce, groundnut oil, rice wine and five-spice powder. Add the drumsticks, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Then, let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator for as long as possible. Overnight is ideal, but 10 minutes is fine if you do not have enough time.<br/>
2) When ready to cook, preheat an oven to 180°C. Arrange the chicken drumsticks on a roasting pan, and roast for 30 mins, or until their skins are golden.

<p>Preheat the oven to 190°C. Combine all the harissa butter ingredients in a food processor and blend until almost smooth. Position the fat chicken onto a clean, flat surface and wiggle its legs; now push your fingers gently under the skin on the neck end and carefully work the skin away from the flesh. If you have short fingers, use the handle of a wooden spoon and gently lift the skin, without poking holes in it. Once you have lifted the skin off the breast, gently work your fingers down to the thighs and lift the skin there. Divide the harissa butter and push half of the butter under the skin. Position it onto the breast bone and then stroke it down to the thighs, and make sure you cover the breast as well.</p> <p>Rub your buttery hands all over the top and bottom of the chicken and season with salt and pepper. Roast the chicken in the oven until is golden and crisp. Roast it for 15-20 minutes for every 400g. The legs should wiggle when you move them and the juice run clear from the thickest part of the chicken. Please take the time to rest your chicken before you start to carve it. You will be rewarded with a juicy, succulent meal with all the flavour on your plate and not on the chopping board. Serve with a roasted aubergine and courgette salad.</p>

I love this soup; it is earthy from the fragrant Chinese mushrooms and very warming on a cold winter's day. Forget instant noodles - this is a fast and healthier alternative.</i><br/>

1) For the soup base: heat a wok over high heat, add the oil, and stir-fry the ginger and mushrooms until softened. Add the chile, Shaohsing rice wine, hot vegetable stock, bamboo shoots, soy sauces, black rice vinegar and the white pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, thicken with the cornstarch slurry and set aside over low heat.<br/>

                            For the filling:<br/>
1) Preheat the oven to 220C/Gas 7. Put the sweet potatoes on a small roasting pan and bake until easily pierced with a fork, about 40 minutes. Peel the cooked sweet potatoes and mash lightly with a fork; you should have about 450ml puree.<p>
2) Mix the sweet potatoes and butter in the food processor until smooth. Add the remaining ingredients and pulse to combine. Set aside.<p>
For the pastry case:<br/>
1) Pulse the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor with the metal blade until combined. Add the fat and pulse about 10 times. Add the butter and continue to pulse until it resembles cornmeal mixed with bean-size bits of butter.<p>
2) Beat the egg yolk and vinegar together, add to the processor and pulse 3 to 4 times, but don't let the dough form a ball in the machine. Remove the blade, and gather the dough together by hand. If dough does not come together, sprinkle up to 1 tbsp of ice cold water over it and bring together.<p>
3) Wrap the dough in cling film and shape into disk. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. <p>
4) Lightly dust the counter with flour. Roll the dough into a 30cm circle and transfer to a prepared pie tin. Trim the dough so that the edges hang about 1cm over the tin; fold the edges under and flute as desired.<p>
5) Pierce the crust all over with a fork, and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes or up to a day. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and heat the oven to 220C/Gas mark 7.<p>
6) Line the case with foil or baking paper, add pie weights or dried beans and place on a baking tray. Bake until the crust sets and begins to brown around the edges, about 25 minutes.<p>
7) Lift the foil and weights out of the crust, lower the oven temperature to 190C/Gas 5 and continue to bake until the crust begins to brown on the bottom, about 10 to 12 minutes more.<p>
8) Pour the filling into the warm crust and bake until set, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on rack <p>
For the topping:<br/>
When ready to serve, whip the cream with the whiskey until it holds soft peaks. Top the pie with whipped cream and candied pecans. Serve. <p>
For the candied pecans:<br/>
1) Preheat the oven to 180C/Gas 4. Lightly beat the egg white until frothy. Whisk in the sugar and cinnamon, and then toss pecans in the mixture.<p>
2) Evenly spread the nuts on a baking paper lined baking tray. Bake until dry and toasted, about 10 to 15 minutes. Cool.<p>
Busy Bakers Tips:<br/>
The crust can be made, rolled and transferred to the pan, then tightly wrapped and frozen for up to a month.
The candied pecans can be made and stored in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.

Whisk in the butter and sour cream and place the bowl over a pot of gently simmering water, whisking often, until the lime curd has thickened, about 10 minutes.  Strain the curd and spread this gently over the cheesecake.  Once fully cooled to room temperature, chill the cheesecake for at least 6 hours (do not cover with cling film).</p>
<p>For the topping, whip the cream and skim milk powder to a soft peak.  Stir in the sugar and vanilla and spread this over the cheesecake, leaving a 2-inches of the lime curd visible around the outside.  Top the cream with blueberries and chill until ready to serve.</p>

<p>For the cheesecake: </p>
<p>Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 170C/Gas 3. Line a 20 by 20cm baking tin with foil, letting long flaps overlap on each side. Spray the foil with nonstick spray. </p>
<p>Break up the brown sugar to remove all lumps. In a standing mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and sugar on a medium speed until very smooth. Add the cream and beat slowly; then add the yolks and vanilla, mixing until just combined. Gently stir in peanut butter. Take care not to over beat the mixture; this incorporates too much air and causes the cheesecake to crack. </p>
<p>Pour the batter over the prepared baking tin, making sure it is evenly spread. Bake for 15 minutes. Open the oven to release some heat, then lower the temperature to 93°C.</p>
<p>Continue to bake the cheesecake until the outside is set but the centre is still loose, for about 45 minutes. Turn off the oven, and cool cheesecake in the oven for 45 more minutes. </p>
<p>Remove the cheesecake from the oven, cover and refrigerate at least eight hours or overnight. Lift cheesecake from the pan by lifting up the foil. Transfer to a cutting board. </p>
<p>Cut the cheesecake into 3 1/2cm cubes. Stick a wooden cocktail stick halfway into each cube and freeze for one hour. </p>
<p>For the chocolate:</p>
<p>Meanwhile, put the shortening and chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with 2.5cm or so of water to a very slow simmer and set the bowl over, but not touching, the water. </p>
<p>Stir the chocolate occasionally until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly. (Alternatively, put the chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Melt at 50% power in the microwave until soft, about one minute. Stir, and continue to heat until completely melted, about one minute more.) </p>
<p>Dip each cube of cheesecake into the chocolate mixture, and stand on waxed paper to set, about five minutes. Serve cold (straight from the fridge), or freeze up to two weeks. Frozen pops make a cool summer treat, or can be allowed to temper for ten minutes at room temperature before serving. </p>
<p><i>Cook's Note: Coat the pops with chopped nuts or candies for a really decadent finish. To do this let the dipped pops drip over a bowl for 15 seconds before rolling them.</i></p>

<p>1. To make the dough: In a small bowl, combine the yeast, sugar and water and stir gently to dissolve. Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>2. If you're using a stand mixer, combine the salt and flour to the bowl and pulse a few times to mix. Add the yeast mixture, at the lowest speed, until the flour incorporates. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough gathers into a ball. This should take about 2 minutes. Add the olive oil and pulse a few more times. Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Get a feel for the dough as you're making it by squeezing a small amount together between your thumb and fingers.  If it's crumbly, add more water, if it's sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it over itself a few times, kneading until it's smooth and elastic.</p>
<p>3. If you're making the dough by hand, add the yeast mixture to a large bowl and stir in the salt and the 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Then begin stirring in the flour. When the mixture becomes too stiff to stir with a spoon, knead in the rest of the flour by hand, adding just enough so that the dough is soft but not too sticky.  As you work, squeeze a small amount of dough together between your thumb and fingers. If it's crumbly, add more water; if it's sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>4. Form the dough into a round and put it into a lightly oiled bowl, turning it over to coat the dough entirely with the oil.  Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot (i.e., over a gas pilot light) until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.</p>
<p>5. Preheat the oven to 220°C. Put a Swiss roll tin or a sheet tray in the oven.</p><p>Begin by making the tomato sauce. In a large saute pan over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons olive oil, the minced garlic, thyme and oregano. Cook until just fragrant then add the crushed tomatoes and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Lower the heat and simmer for 7 to 8 minutes to reduce and concentrate the flavor. Shut off the heat and set aside.</p>
<p>6. Take the preheated pan out of the oven and drizzle some olive oil over the entire surface. Cut the dough into 2 pieces and reserve 1 piece for another use. Stretch the pizza dough out so it is just bigger than the pan, then lay it inside the pan, so the dough comes up the sides to form a crust on the rim. Smear with tomato sauce then tear up the mozzarella and scatter it evenly over the top of the pie. Tear the basil leaves, spread them over the top and drizzle with a little more olive oil.  Give it a final season with salt and pepper, to taste, then bake in the hot oven until golden and bubbly, about 15 to 18 minutes</p>

<p>1. For the cake, preheat the oven to 160°C. Grease 2 8-inch round cake pans, line the bottoms with parchment paper and then lightly dust the sides of the pan with flour, tapping out any excess. *Please note that only 1 cake layer is needed for this recipe, but it is easiest to make this recipe in its full measure and freeze the second cake for a later use.</p>
<p>2. Whisk the boiling water, chocolate and butter together until melted (it will be visibly grainy) and set aside.</p>
<p>3. Whip the egg, sugar and vanilla until the mixture doubles in volume (about 2 minutes on high speed) and then fold in the chocolate mixture by hand.</p>
<p>4. Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt over the batter and fold in, then stir in the hot coffee (this will make the batter become fluid). Divide the batter evenly between the 2 pans.</p>
<p>5. Bake the cakes for about 25 minutes, until a tester inserted in the centre of the cake comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool completely in the pans.</p>
<p>6. For the mousse, have ready a 9-inch springform pan, lining the bottom with parchment paper (in order to make the mousse-filled cake easier to remove from the pan). Whip 360ml of the whipping cream until it holds a medium peak when the beaters are lifted and chill.</p>
<p>7. Heat the remaining 360ml of cream to just below a simmer and then pour it over the chopped chocolate. Let this sit one minute, then gently stir until incorporated. Set aside.</p>
<p>8. Place the egg yolks in a bowl and whip for a minute on high speed. Place the sugar and water in a small saucepot over high heat and boil (occasionally brushing the sides of the pot with water) until it reaches 120°C on a candy thermometer. Start whipping the egg yolks on medium speed and then carefully pour the hot sugar down the side of the bowl to avoid splashing, and then increase the mixer speed until high and whip until this has doubled in volume and cooled to about 40°C (just above body temperature). </p>
<p>9. Measure the temperature of the ganache to ensure it is close to 40°C as well, and fold the ganache into the whipped yolks. Let this cool for 15 minutes, or until just above room temperature, then fold in the chilled whipped cream in 2 additions.</p>
<p>10. Pour half of the mousse into the ungreased springform pan. Slice one of the cake layers in half horizontally and place this over the mousse, as centred as possible. Pour the remaining mousse over the cake layer and gently place the other half of the cake layer on top, pressing gently just so the mousse covers the sides of the cake, but not so that it sinks in.  Wrap the pan in plastic wrap and freeze the cake to set it, at least 4 hours, or overnight.</p>
<p>11. While the cake is setting, prepare the glaze. Bring the water, sugar, and cream to a boil in a medium saucepot. Once boiling, whisk in the cocoa powder and simmer (reducing the heat if needed) for 4 minutes, stirring often, (the consistency will not change).  Remove from heat. Soften the gelatin in 60ml of cold water and then whisk this into the hot cocoa mixture until dissolved. Cool the glaze to room temperature, then chill completely, at least 3 hours.</p>
<p>12. To finish the cake, remove it from the freezer invert the pan onto a cooling rack placed over a parchment-lined baking tray. Use a hair dryer on a low, hot setting to gently warm the pan so that it releases from the pan, the sides first and then the top. Warm the chilled glaze while whisking occasionally until just melted and smooth and pour this over the torte, spreading gently with a spatula to ensure that it covers the top and sides of the torte evenly. Chill the cake for at least 30 minutes, then lift it onto your presentation plate and store chilled until ready to serve.</p>
<p>13. The cake will keep, refrigerated, for up to 4 days.</p>

<p>3. Stir the hot coffee, milk and vanilla together and add it all at once to the flour mixture, blending until smooth. Break the eggs into a small dish and stir them with a fork and then add them to the batter, again blending on medium speed just until smooth (the batter will be very fluid). Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and tap them on the counter to eliminate any bubbles.</p>
<p>4. Bake the cakes for about 30 minutes, until a tester inserted in the centre of the cake comes out clean. Cool the cakes for 20 minutes in their pans, then tip out onto a cooling rack to cool completely to room temperature. The cakes can be baked a day ahead, wrapped and stored at room temperature before frosting.</p>
<p>5. For the frosting, place the chocolate and cream in a metal bowl and place it over a pot of barely simmering water. Stir the chocolate and cream occasionally and gently until all the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk in the sour cream, vanilla and salt.  Let the mixture cool completely to room temperature, stir occasionally (you can chill the mixture for just a few minutes to start it setting, then let it continue to cool naturally at room temperature). Once cooled to a thicker consistency, whisk by hand to thicken just until spreadable consistency (do not whip vigorously or with electric beaters).</p>
<p>6. Place the first cake layers on your serving plate and, if needed, trim the cake to level it. Spread a generous layer of the frosting over the top of the cake. Trim the second cake, if needed and place this on top of the first cake layer. Spread frosting over the top and then the sides of the cake, using swirling motion with your spatula to create a nice design. Chill the cake for at least 2 hours, or until ready to serve.</p>
<p>7. The cake will keep, refrigerated, for up to 3 days.</p>

<p>4. Check on them after 15 minutes, they should be firm to touch. (You can also test by popping a skewer into the middle of the cupcake, it should come out clean). If not ready, leave them in for a further five minutes. Remove from the oven and leave to cool.</p>
<p>5. While the cupcakes are cooling, make the buttercream topping. Place the butter into a bowl and stir in the icing sugar and vanilla extract using a wooden spoon. Then whisk (again using an electric mixer) until fluffy and lighter in colour.</p>
<p>Add two teaspoons of milk and whisk again. If the mixture is still too stiff add a little more milk.</p>

<p><strong>For the strawberries:</strong></p>
<p>1. Hollow the strawberries carefully. If you pierce the side of the strawberry accidentally, start with a new one. Since you'll be setting the alcohol aflame, it is very important that the strawberry is leak-proof.</p>
<p>2. Set one strawberry atop each frosted cupcake. Fill strawberries with liquor just before lighting. If you need to light them all at once, (say, for a party) use a turkey baster to quickly fill all the strawberries and a grill lighter in lieu of matches.</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C/Gas mark 4. Take two 12-hole muffin trays and line 16 of the holes with paper muffin cases.</p>
<p>Melt the chocolate, butter and sugar together in a large heatproof bowl (make sure it’s large, as you will eventually add everything else to this bowl, too). Ideally, do this in a microwave on medium heat for 1 minute at a time, stirring at each interval, until all melted together. Alternatively, place the bowl over a pan of simmering (not boiling) water until the chocolate is melted and the ingredients are amalgamated. Allow to cool slightly.</p>
<p>Whisk the whole eggs and yolks, soured cream and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl.</p>

<p>Gently fold in the flour mixture until all the dry flour and cocoa has been incorporated into the wet ingredients.</p>
<p>Spoon into the paper cases, around half full. Bake for 15–20 minutes until just firm. Test with a sharp knife to ensure they are cooked through. Allow to cool for 5 minutes then turn out onto a wire rack. Once cool, decorate as required.</p>
<p>To make the ganache, place all the ingredients together in a microwave-proof bowl and microwave on medium for 1 minute. Stir the mixture, then put back in the microwave and repeat the process until all the ingredients are melted together. Alternatively, you can place all the ingredients in a pan and heat gently, stirring often, until melted together.</p>
<p>Leave to cool slightly. The ganache is now ready to use.</p>
<p>To make the decoration, you will need a small amount of chocolate ganache in a piping bag with a No. 3 nozzle, 16 large chocolate-paste roses in bright multi-colours or chocolate shades if you prefer (alternatively, 16 sugar snowflakes cut from caramel-coloured petal paste with a plunger cutter, decorated with gold lustre dust or spray – great for Christmas!)</p>
<p>Make sure that once you have poured the chocolate ganache covering over your cupcakes, you leave them to set for a few hours, otherwise the decorations may sink into the topping.</p>
<p>When the ganache cake covering is set, pipe a small pearl of chocolate ganache onto the centre of each cupcake.</p>
<p>Attach the chocolate roses or snowflakes to finish.</p>
<p>Display on a large platter and serve as dessert at your party, or scoff them all by yourself.</p>

<p>Ladle or pour the batter into the cupcake cups, filling to about ¾ full.  Bake for about 25 minutes, until a tester inserted in the centre of a cupcake comes out clean.  Cool the cupcakes in their tins for 10 minutes, then remove to cool on a rack.</p>
<p>To insert the truffle, use a melon baller to scoop out a circle of cake from the top of each cupcake.  Use the same melon baller, dipped in a little warm water to scoop our truffles of the same size, and gently press a truffle into each cupcake.</p>
<p>For the frosting, beat the cream cheese and butter until smooth and fluffy.  Add the icing sugar and vanilla and beat first on low speed then on high, until the frosting is light and fluffy.  Remove half of the frosting to a bowl and set aside.  Beat in the melted chocolate into the remaining frosting.</p>
<p>Prepare a large piping bag with a large star tip.  Spoon the vanilla frosting carefully down one side of the piping bag, and then spoon the chocolate frosting down the opposite side.  Squeeze out a little frosting to start the “swirl” effect, then pipe spiral twists of frosting on to of each cupcake.  Chill the cupcakes for at least an hour before serving.</p>
<p>The cupcakes are best served chilled and will keep refrigerated for up to 3 days.</p>

<p>Special equipment: a pastry bag fitted with a star tip</p>
<p>1. For the cake: Preheat the oven to 175°C. Lightly coat two 9-inch round cake pans with oil and dust with flour. Whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt in a small bowl; set aside.</p>
<p>2. Microwave the chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl on high power for 45 seconds; remove and stir. Microwave again at high power in 30-second increments, stirring in between, until the chocolate has melted completely; set aside.</p>
<p>3. Beat the granulated sugar, oil and eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Beat in the melted chocolate. Alternate beating in the flour mixture and the milk, adding the flour in three additions and the milk in two, starting and ending with the flour, until just incorporated. Add half the milk, and mix until just incorporated. Repeat with the remaining flour mixture and milk, making sure not to overmix. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.</p>
<p>4. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool in the pans for 10 minutes, run a thin spatula around the edges and then turn the cakes out onto a cooling rack to cool completely. (They will have a sugary ""crust"" on the top. This is from the melted chocolate and is not a problem. It will soften once the cake is assembled or if the layers are baked the day before.)</p>
<p>5. For the filling: While the cakes cool, spread the pecans on a baking sheet and bake, tossing once, until toasted, 8 to 10 minutes. Finely chop. Whisk together the milk and egg yolks in a medium saucepan until smooth. Add the brown sugar, butter, corn syrup, vanilla and salt, and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture has thickened and coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 6 minutes. (It will be similar to the thickness of custard.) Pour the mixture into a large bowl. (Don't worry if it seems thin. The coconut and nuts will bind it.) Stir in the coconut and pecans; set aside to cool.</p>
<p>6. For the frosting: Put the chocolate in a medium bowl. Heat 1 cup of the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until steaming but not boiling, and pour over the chocolate. Let stand a few minutes, and then whisk until smooth; let stand at room temperature (or put in the refrigerator if your kitchen is hot) until thick but not set, 20 minutes to 1 hour. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons cream to the chocolate mixture, and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until lightened in color and fluffy, about 1 minute (do not overbeat, or it will become hard and grainy). The frosting should hold medium peaks and will continue to firm up a bit as it stands. Spoon about 1 cup frosting into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip.</p>
<p>7. To assemble: Put one cake layer right-side up on a serving plate, and top with half the filling. Top with the second cake layer and the remaining filling, spreading it to about 1/2 inch from the edge. Frost the sides, and decorate around the top edge of the cake with the frosting in the pastry bag.</p>
<p>8. Loosely cover the cake with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature overnight. Unwrap and serve.</p>
<p>9. Letting the cake sit overnight makes it more moist, tastier and easier to cut.</p>

<p>5. Bake the cakes for about 25 minutes, until a tester inserted in the centre of the cake comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool completely in the pans.</p>
<p>6. For the mousse, have ready a 9-inch springform pan, lining the bottom with parchment paper (in order to make the mousse-filled cake easier to remove from the pan). Whip 360ml of the whipping cream until it holds a medium peak when the beaters are lifted and chill.</p>
<p>7. Heat the remaining 360ml of cream to just below a simmer and then pour it over the chopped chocolate. Let this sit one minute, then gently stir until incorporated. Set aside.</p>
<p>8. Place the egg yolks in a bowl and whip for a minute on high speed. Place the sugar and water in a small saucepot over high heat and boil (occasionally brushing the sides of the pot with water) until it reaches 120°C on a candy thermometer. Start whipping the egg yolks on medium speed and then carefully pour the hot sugar down the side of the bowl to avoid splashing, and then increase the mixer speed until high and whip until this has doubled in volume and cooled to about 40°C (just above body temperature). </p>
<p>9. Measure the temperature of the ganache to ensure it is close to 40°C as well, and fold the ganache into the whipped yolks. Let this cool for 15 minutes, or until just above room temperature, then fold in the chilled whipped cream in 2 additions.</p>
<p>10. Pour half of the mousse into the ungreased springform pan. Slice one of the cake layers in half horizontally and place this over the mousse, as centred as possible. Pour the remaining mousse over the cake layer and gently place the other half of the cake layer on top, pressing gently just so the mousse covers the sides of the cake, but not so that it sinks in.  Wrap the pan in plastic wrap and freeze the cake to set it, at least 4 hours, or overnight.</p>
<p>11. While the cake is setting, prepare the glaze. Bring the water, sugar, and cream to a boil in a medium saucepot. Once boiling, whisk in the cocoa powder and simmer (reducing the heat if needed) for 4 minutes, stirring often, (the consistency will not change).  Remove from heat. Soften the gelatin in 60ml of cold water and then whisk this into the hot cocoa mixture until dissolved. Cool the glaze to room temperature, then chill completely, at least 3 hours.</p>
<p>12. To finish the cake, remove it from the freezer invert the pan onto a cooling rack placed over a parchment-lined baking tray. Use a hair dryer on a low, hot setting to gently warm the pan so that it releases from the pan, the sides first and then the top. Warm the chilled glaze while whisking occasionally until just melted and smooth and pour this over the torte, spreading gently with a spatula to ensure that it covers the top and sides of the torte evenly. Chill the cake for at least 30 minutes, then lift it onto your presentation plate and store chilled until ready to serve.</p>
<p>13. The cake will keep, refrigerated, for up to 4 days.</p>

                            1) In a large bowl mix the pork, turkey, ricotta, parsley, panko crumbs, onion, pecorino, bacon, garlic, milk, thyme, egg, salt, Worcestershire sauce and black pepper to taste. Mix until just combined; don't overmix. The mixture will be pretty soft. <p>
2) Take tablespoons of the mixture and using your hands, gently form into meatballs about the size of ping pong balls. Put them on a large plate; cover and refrigerate for at least one or up to 24 hours.<p>
3) Heat the oil in a medium non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add about a third of the meatballs and cook, turning occasionally, until well browned on all sides, about 6 mins. Transfer the meatballs to a plate and repeat with the remaining meatballs.<p>
4) Drain off the oil and wipe out the pan. Return the meatballs to the pan and pour in the marinara sauce. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, cover and simmer until the meatballs are cooked through, about 15 mins. <p>
5) Serve the meatballs with cocktail sticks on a platter with a dollop of the sauce and a fresh leaf of basil. They can be serve warm or at room temperature.<p>
Cook's Note: Be gentle when you're forming meatballs – too firm a hand makes them dense and tough. <br/>
The uncooked meatballs can be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for three days, or frozen for up to six weeks. <br/>
The cooked meatballs can be frozen with or without the sauce.

<p>Turn the oven down to 120°C and roast for a further 1 1/2 hours until very tender.</p>
<p>Meanwhile peel, quarter and de-seed the pears and cut them into chunks. In a saucepan over a medium heat, melt the butter, add the pears and caster sugar and cook until the pears become soft and start to stew. This will take around 25 minutes. If the mixture is still very chunky, mash with a fork to get a smoother consistency. Take off the heat and allow to cool.</p>
<p>Next, peel the black pudding and discard the skin. Cut into chunks and blend in a food processor until mixed but not pureed. Divide the mix into two and between two sheets of greaseproof paper roll each mix thinly into rectangles that will fit into an 20cm x 5cm rectangle tray. Place in the fridge to set, until it's needed.</p>
<p>Remove the pork from the oven and rest for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Carefully peel or cut the crackling away from the meat and, if you can resist, put it to one side. Shred the boneless meat with two forks, the meat should resemble string and tear very easily. Season the meat, and add the chopped chives and leftover cooking fat from the pork, mixing thoroughly. In the bowl roughly divide into two and put to one side.</p>
<p>Line the tray with two layers of cling-film. Take one sheet of black pudding and lay in the bottom of the tin. Then take half of the pork belly mix and lay on top of the black pudding keeping as level as possible.</p>
<p>Next, spoon on the pear sauce, spreading evenly. Then add the second layer of pork belly and finish off with the final layer of black pudding.</p>
<p>Wrap tightly in cling film with a weight on top and rest in the fridge for four hours or overnight.
Unwrap and cut into neat 5cm squares. You should end up with 20 even squares.</p>

                            For the caramel peaches: <br/>
1) Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 180C/Gas 4. Butter a 23-cm cake tin, line the bottom with greaseproof paper and brush the paper with butter. <p>
2) Combine the sugar, golden syrup, allspice and water in a medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to high, and continue to cook, without stirring, until the mixture becomes an amber caramel, about 5 mins. Pour the caramel into the prepared tin and set aside to cool. <p>
3) Halve and pit the peaches, but leave their skins on. Cut each half into 3 wedges. Arrange the wedges in concentric circles in the tin. Set aside while you make the cake batter. <p>
For the cake: <br/>
1) Whisk the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt in a medium bowl.<p>
2) Slowly mix the butter and sugar in a large bowl with a hand-held electric mixer. Increase the speed to high, and continue beating until the butter is light and fluffy, about 5 mins. Add the eggs 1 at time, waiting for each to be fully incorporated before adding the next.<p>
3) While mixing at a low speed, add the dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with the sour cream in 2 additions, beginning and ending with the flour. Increase the speed to medium and mix briefly to make a smooth batter. Pour the batter over the peaches and smooth over. <p>
4) Bake the cake until golden brown and a cocktail stick inserted in the centre comes out clean, about 40 to 45 mins. Cool the cake in the tin on a rack, about 20 mins. <p>
5) Run a knife around the edge of the tin to release the cake. Carefully invert the cake onto a serving plate and remove the greaseproof paper. Serve warm or at room temperature with ice cream or whipped cream, if desired.

                            1) Sift the icing sugar. Put 60g of the sifted icing sugar, 280g of the almonds and all the cinnamon in a food processor. Process until the nuts are finely ground, with just a few larger pieces. <p>
2) Whip the egg whites in a large, clean bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until they hold soft peaks, about one minute. Gradually add the remaining icing sugar while whipping, until the whites are thick, creamy and somewhat stiff, about two minutes more. Set aside two thirds of cup of this meringue for topping the biscuits. Fold the ground almond mixture and the lemon zest into the remaining meringue to make a stiff dough. <p>
3) Preheat the oven to 120°C / gas mark 1/2, or the oven's lowest setting. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. <p>
4) Lay a sheet of parchment or waxed paper on the work surface and lightly dust with icing sugar. Turn the dough out onto the dusted paper, flatten and dust with more sugar as needed, and then lay another sheet of parchment or waxed paper on top. Roll the dough between the papers until it is about 1/2cm thick. Flip the dough over and gently peel off a sheet of the paper. For ease when cutting, lay the paper back on the dough, flip again and gently pull off the other side of the paper so that the dough is fully released from it.<p>
5) Cut the biscuits with a 7.5cm star cutter and place about 5cm apart on the prepared baking sheets. (Excess dough can be rerolled.) Use a small spoon, brush or offset spatula to spread the reserved meringue over the top of each star, taking care not to let the meringue drip over the sides. Press or sprinkle the remaining sliced almonds in a decorative pattern into the meringue. <p>
6) Bake the biscuits until the bottoms are light golden brown and the meringue is set and crisp, about 30 mins. Turn off the oven and open the oven door to release heat and dry out the biscuits in the oven for 10 more mins. <p>
Busy Baker's Tips: The dough can be frozen between the sheets of paper for up to 2 weeks. <br/>
Store baked cookies in an airtight container for up to 10 days.

<p>Place the whole peppers and aubergines into a roasting dish and drizzle over a little oil then season with salt and pepper. Roast in the preheated oven for 25 minutes, then add the cherry tomatoes and roast for a further 20 minutes, or until the skins of the peppers and aubergines are slightly charred (the aubergines may need a little longer than the peppers). </p>
<p>Once roasted allow to cool completely, then peel the aubergines and peppers and pull them apart into strips of flesh. Meanwhile caramelise the onion. Heat a little oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the finely sliced onion and allow to slowly cook down for about 10 minutes or until softened. Add the sugar and vinegar and cook for a further 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are dark, sticky and sweet. Allow to cool. </p>
<p>Place the couscous into a heatproof bowl and crumble in the stock cube along with a little salt and pepper. Give it a good mix together, then pour over some hot water so that it covers the couscous by about 2cm. Cover with cling and allow to soak for a few minutes, until the couscous has swollen and the water is all absorbed. Once cool, add the strips of pepper and aubergine, the roasted tomatoes, caramelised onions, spice mix, chilli and coriander as well as a good pinch of salt and pepper. </p>
<p>Give it a good mix, then crumble in the goats cheese and mix through gently. Make sure you taste it to ensure the seasoning is just right. </p>
<p>For the pastry, place the clean table cloth onto the counter top. Line up 5 sheets of filo pastry, top to bottom, overlapping each one over the previous one by a good 2 inches. Repeat with the other 5 starting from the same point, overlapping over the previous 5 by 2 inches. </p>

<p>1. Put the raisins and sultanas into a bowl and cover with half of the orange liqueur. Cover the bowl and set aside for 24 hours.</p>
<p>2. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 150°C. Grease a 20 cm springform cake tin and double line it.</p>
<p>3. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugars using an electric hand mix, until the mixture is light, pale and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, continuing to whisk. If the mixture looks like it is going to split, add a small amount of the measured flour.</p>
<p>4. Put the chocolate pieces in a heatproof bowl that fits over a pan of gently simmering water (the base must not touch the water), and stir until it melts.</p>
<p>5. Leave to cool slightly. Add the cooled melted chocolate to the egg mixture. Sift in the flour, mixed spice, cinnamon and nutmeg and fold in so everything is well combined.

<p>6. Spoon the mix into the prepared tin. Level the surface and cover the top loosely with a piece of baking paper. Bake in the preheated oven for 2-2 1/2 hours, depending on your oven. Test to see whether the cake is cooked by inserting a thin metal skewer into the middle; if it comes out clean the cake is done.</p>
<p>7. Cool the cake in its tin on a wire rack, then remove from the tin, and peel off the lining paper.</p>
<p>8. Feed the cake once a week with orange liqueur. Do this by carefully pouring straight from the bottle, but if you prefer use a small ladle. Wrap the cake in clingfilm until ready to decorate.</p>
<p>9. This cake is best eaten within three weeks. To decorate, warm the apricot jam and, using a pastry brush, glaze the top all over. Arrange the fruit and nuts on top and glaze these too. If you like, highlight with a gold leaf for an extra special touch.</p>

Combine the potatoes with the bacon, flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mix well to combine.</p>
<p>Form the potato mixture into small logs using a 1 tablespoon measuring spoon. Working in batches, fry the bites in the skillet until golden brown, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Adjust the heat, as needed, to keep the oil at 150°C. Transfer the tots to a paper-towel-lined plate to strain excess fat. Sprinkle the bites with salt while still warm.</p>

Use the back of a measuring cup or drinking glass to pack the crust firmly and evenly in to the edges of the pan. Bake until the crust is lightly crisp and set, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool completely, then set the pan on top of a large sheet of aluminum foil and wrap the foil around the bottom of the pan and up the sides.

Bake until the edges of the cheesecake are set but the center still jiggles when the pan is tapped, about 2 hours. Turn off the oven and open the oven door for 1 minute to let out some heat. Close the oven door and leave the cheesecake in the oven for 1 hour more. Carefully remove the cheesecake from the roasting pan, remove the foil and cool on a wire rack.

<p>Unlike most samosas, these aren’t fried. This both makes them healthier and somehow intensifies the flavour of the filling. Cinnamon is fabulous with sweet potato. I serve these with a peppery watercress dip – a kind of Indo-Italian pesto – with coriander and lemon (once, by accident, I used orange instead and it was great, so try it). If you grow nasturtiums, use the leaves instead of watercress; it tastes unbelievable. These are smart enough to serve with drinks.</p>
<p>Place the 1 teaspoon cumin seeds in a dry frying pan and toast until golden and fragrant. Remove to a mortar and crush with a pestle. Put the sweet potato in a pan, cover with water and add salt. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for six to eight minutes until tender. Drain and cool. Place in a bowl and mix with the cheese, spring onions, coriander, chilli, chilli flakes, crushed cumin, cinnamon and garlic. Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6.</p>
<p>Melt the butter. Lay a sheet of filo on a work surface and brush with butter. Place a second sheet on top to fit over the first. Brush this with butter too. Cut into strips about 5cm wide. Spoon 1 heaped teaspoon of filling into one corner. Fold the right corner of the strip over to the left side to create a triangle. Continue to fold the triangle along the strip to the end, cutting off surplus pastry. Repeat to use up all the pastry and filling. Brush liberally with butter and sprinkle with cumin seeds and rock salt. Bake for 12–15 minutes, until golden.</p>

<p>To make the perfect poached eggs: The secret to a good poached egg is to use the freshest eggs possible. Fill a non-stick frying pan with water and bring to a gentle simmer. Crack in the eggs (make sure they sit below the surface of the water) and cook gently for 3 – 8 minutes until the eggs are set to your liking. Drain with a slotted spoon and serve.</p>
<p>Note: Softly-cooked eggs are not recommended for children under 5 so please make sure the yolks are cooked all the way through.</p>

                            For the filling:<br/>
1) Preheat the oven to 220C/Gas 7. Put the sweet potatoes on a small roasting pan and bake until easily pierced with a fork, about 40 minutes. Peel the cooked sweet potatoes and mash lightly with a fork; you should have about 450ml puree.<p>
2) Mix the sweet potatoes and butter in the food processor until smooth. Add the remaining ingredients and pulse to combine. Set aside.<p>
For the pastry case:<br/>
1) Pulse the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor with the metal blade until combined. Add the fat and pulse about 10 times. Add the butter and continue to pulse until it resembles cornmeal mixed with bean-size bits of butter.<p>
2) Beat the egg yolk and vinegar together, add to the processor and pulse 3 to 4 times, but don't let the dough form a ball in the machine. Remove the blade, and gather the dough together by hand. If dough does not come together, sprinkle up to 1 tbsp of ice cold water over it and bring together.<p>
3) Wrap the dough in cling film and shape into disk. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. <p>
4) Lightly dust the counter with flour. Roll the dough into a 30cm circle and transfer to a prepared pie tin. Trim the dough so that the edges hang about 1cm over the tin; fold the edges under and flute as desired.<p>
5) Pierce the crust all over with a fork, and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes or up to a day. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and heat the oven to 220C/Gas mark 7.<p>
6) Line the case with foil or baking paper, add pie weights or dried beans and place on a baking tray. Bake until the crust sets and begins to brown around the edges, about 25 minutes.<p>
7) Lift the foil and weights out of the crust, lower the oven temperature to 190C/Gas 5 and continue to bake until the crust begins to brown on the bottom, about 10 to 12 minutes more.<p>
8) Pour the filling into the warm crust and bake until set, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on rack <p>
For the topping:<br/>
When ready to serve, whip the cream with the whiskey until it holds soft peaks. Top the pie with whipped cream and candied pecans. Serve. <p>
For the candied pecans:<br/>
1) Preheat the oven to 180C/Gas 4. Lightly beat the egg white until frothy. Whisk in the sugar and cinnamon, and then toss pecans in the mixture.<p>
2) Evenly spread the nuts on a baking paper lined baking tray. Bake until dry and toasted, about 10 to 15 minutes. Cool.<p>
Busy Bakers Tips:<br/>
The crust can be made, rolled and transferred to the pan, then tightly wrapped and frozen for up to a month.
The candied pecans can be made and stored in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.

<p>1. For the pastry, place the butter in the freezer for about 20 minutes until very hard. Sift the flour and a pinch of salt into a mixing bowl. Working quickly, hold the butter using a piece of baking parchment and coarsley grate it into the flour. Stir the butter and flour together, sprinkle with about 6 tbsp very cold water and mix to make a dough, adding a little more water if needed. Wrap in clingfilm and chill for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>2. To make the filling, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan and cook the onion for about 5-8 minutes until really softened. Add the garlic and cook for a further minute. Stir in the spices, combine well then tip in the sweet potato.</p>
<p>3. Add the tomato pure?e and cook for 1 minute before adding the chopped tomatoes and about 150ml water. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for about 15 minutes, until the sauce is thickened and the sweet potato is softened but still holding its shape. Set aside to cool.</p>
<p>4. When ready to make the pasties, roll out half of the pastry (it's easier to handle if you do it half at a time). Using a saucer, cut out a disc measuring 18cm in diameter. Repeat with the remaining pastry until you have 6 discs.</p>
<p>5. Stir the coriander into the sweet potato mixture. Spoon a heaped tablespoon of the mixture onto one side of each pastry disc and top with a spoonful of the ricotta. Brush the edges of the pastry with a little beaten egg then fold over to make a half moon shape. Seal the edges either with a fork or by pinching the pastry with your finger and thumb. Place on a baking tray lined with baking parchment.</p>
<p>6. Brush the top of each pasty with a little more beaten egg and sprinkle with nigella seeds. Bake for 20 minutes until golden and crispy. Delicious served with a simple mixed leaf salad and French dressing.</p>

<p>1. To make the dough: In a small bowl, combine the yeast, sugar and water and stir gently to dissolve. Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>2. If you're using a stand mixer, combine the salt and flour to the bowl and pulse a few times to mix. Add the yeast mixture, at the lowest speed, until the flour incorporates. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough gathers into a ball. This should take about 2 minutes. Add the olive oil and pulse a few more times. Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Get a feel for the dough as you're making it by squeezing a small amount together between your thumb and fingers.  If it's crumbly, add more water, if it's sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it over itself a few times, kneading until it's smooth and elastic.</p>
<p>3. If you're making the dough by hand, add the yeast mixture to a large bowl and stir in the salt and the 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Then begin stirring in the flour. When the mixture becomes too stiff to stir with a spoon, knead in the rest of the flour by hand, adding just enough so that the dough is soft but not too sticky.  As you work, squeeze a small amount of dough together between your thumb and fingers. If it's crumbly, add more water; if it's sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>4. Form the dough into a round and put it into a lightly oiled bowl, turning it over to coat the dough entirely with the oil.  Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot (i.e., over a gas pilot light) until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.</p>
<p>5. Preheat the oven to 220°C. Put a Swiss roll tin or a sheet tray in the oven.</p><p>Begin by making the tomato sauce. In a large saute pan over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons olive oil, the minced garlic, thyme and oregano. Cook until just fragrant then add the crushed tomatoes and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Lower the heat and simmer for 7 to 8 minutes to reduce and concentrate the flavor. Shut off the heat and set aside.</p>
<p>6. Take the preheated pan out of the oven and drizzle some olive oil over the entire surface. Cut the dough into 2 pieces and reserve 1 piece for another use. Stretch the pizza dough out so it is just bigger than the pan, then lay it inside the pan, so the dough comes up the sides to form a crust on the rim. Smear with tomato sauce then tear up the mozzarella and scatter it evenly over the top of the pie. Tear the basil leaves, spread them over the top and drizzle with a little more olive oil.  Give it a final season with salt and pepper, to taste, then bake in the hot oven until golden and bubbly, about 15 to 18 minutes</p>

<p>For the dough: Add the flour, butter and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer. Run the machine at its slowest setting for 5 to 7 minutes. Add the yolk, and as the butter starts breaking into the dough, you will notice that your mix will start looking like coarse crumbs. As time goes by, the crumbs will become smaller and smaller until the dough will start forming. This is the only tricky part: in case the dough is not forming right (it's usually because of a small egg yolk), slowly add the cold water, not all at once, just the right amount for the dough to come alive and start detaching from the sides of the bowl. Remove the dough from the mixer, form it into a disc and put it to rest, covered in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 218°C. Butter an 11-inch tart pan.</p>
<p>For the filling: In a pot of boiling water, cook the potatoes half way, for about 15 minutes, then remove from the hot water and set aside to cool off. Once cool, slice into thin slices.</p>
<p>In a medium pan, saute the leeks and shallots over medium heat in the oil and butter until soft and just golden, about 7 minutes. (Or saute the leeks and shallots with the guanciale.) Let cool.</p>
<p>In a bowl, beat the eggs, milk, Parmesan and some salt and pepper. Add the leeks and shallots to the egg mixture and stir well with a fork until all the ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>
<p>Dust some flour on a flat surface. Lightly dust your wood rolling pin and start working the dough. Do not press too hard, give the dough some time to respond to the pin and start softening up. Flip it a couple of times, dust it with flour, and mostly importantly do not guess the size. Keep the buttered pan close and prop it on top of the dough from time to time. Keep in mind that you will have to roll the dough a bit wider, as the pan has edges that need to be completely covered. Place the dough into the tart pan and, using a fork, poke holes into it to prevent swelling during the cooking process.</p>
<p>Pour the egg mixture slowly into the dough, using a spoon to make sure you create an even layer. Get creative and place the sliced potatoes very gently on top of the egg mixture, creating a pleasant concentric pattern. Sprinkle the top of the cake with freshly grated Parmesan, 3 or 4 small tabs of butter and some ground pepper. Place the pan on a sheet tray.</p>
<p>Cook in the oven for about 45 minutes, but make sure you check the cake after the first half hour, turn it around once or twice, and keep an eye on its colour, which is the best indicator. The cake will be ready when the crust looks golden and the butter and cheese on top have become crisp and irresistible! When ready, let your new creation rest and settle for about 10 minutes, then remove from the pan and serve warm.</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 175°C.</p>
<p>Butter a 13 by 9 by 4 baking dish and add a thin layer of white sauce. Cover with a layer of lasagna sheets, and then another thin layer of white sauce. Gently spread about 4 tablespoons pesto across the surface, and then top with about 2 tablespoons Parmesan. Repeat until you finish layering the lasagne. Top with a final layer of lasagne sheest and spread a final very thin layer white sauce, pesto, Parmesan cheese and a little butter to help the cheese crisp-up when cooked in the oven.</p>
<p>Cook the lasagne for about 30 minutes. Serve dressed with some Parmesan and a drop of extra-virgin olive oil.</p>
<p><strong>Fresh pesto:</strong></p>
<p>Combine the basil leaves, pine nuts, garlic, and olive oil in a mortar and pestle and pound until paste forms. Add the Parmesan cheese, Pecorino cheese, salt and pepper and stir until smooth.</p>
<p>Keep the pesto in the refrigerator until you're ready to use it.</p>
<p><strong>For the white sauce:</strong></p>
<p>Melt the 1/2 cup butter in a pan over medium heat. Stir in the flour with a wooden spoon. Cook's Note: This is an important moment, as you have to slowly toast the flour without burning it. This will help you lose the floury taste.</p>
<p>Warm up the milk and gradually ladle into the pot with the butter-flour mixture, whisking constantly while bringing the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat, and simmer for about 15 minutes. Season the sauce with freshly grated nutmeg, salt, and pepper.</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>This is a crucial moment for your pesto, as you need to season with salt and pepper. Keep in mind that Parmigiano and Pecorino are both dry and salty cheeses. You have to taste your sauce a few times in order not to go overboard when you are seasoning it.
If the sauce is too thick, add a little more milk, if too runny, return to the heat and add a pat of butter mixed with an equal amount of plain flour. The most important thing though is: white sauce should not taste floury. If you think your sauce is ready, but you can spot a hint of ""flouriness"" when you taste it, think again, and keep on cooking it for a few minutes more.</p>
